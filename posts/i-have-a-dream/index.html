Going downside, most of the abstraction behind the design of these UNIX or UNIX-like systems cannot make fully usage of modern hardware technologies, rather putting the burden of compatibility on the design of the hardware itself. Going upside, these abstractions are so aged that they force the system programming languages to adopt to these old-fasioned models, making these languages not only unsafe, but also not able to fully utilize the power of modern type systems. Behaviors of programs written in these languages are hard to analyse, and even harder to verify.
Facing the fact that we are bounded to these constraints, I still have a dream.</p><p>I have a dream that one day, computers can discard those abstractions invented when computers were still professional tools for scientists and engineers, resources were measured in kilobytes, and networking was not a thing.</p><p>I have a dream that one day, hardware design is not restricted by the assumption of continuous yet isolated memory space per process, and memory can be safely managed by a runtime. I have a dream that one day, inter-process communication does not need to done by rather passing strings or sharing vulnerable memory, but by exchanging managed references to typed data structures.</p><p>I have a dream that one day, system programmars can code in languages with sound and safe type systems and mathematical models of the semantics, enabling static analysis, verification and eventually proof of the correctness towards programs written in this language. Using these languages, programmars can both write high-performance programs, be confident about the correctness of their programs, and be able to reason about the behavior of their programs logically in the same languages they use to write the programs.</p><p>I have a dream that one day we could rethink the software and hardware stack from the ground up, and build a new generation of computer systems without any historical constraints, discarding the assumptions originated more than half a century ago which do not apply today, and making new abstraction layers that are not only modern, but also elegant and mathematically sound.</p><p>I believe that Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis applies to programming languages, that is, the language we use to write programs decides the way we think about programs, which means that the design of programming languages is the most fundamental part of this dream.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
